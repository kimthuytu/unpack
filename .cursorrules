# Unpack Project Rules

## Git Workflow
- Create a new feature branch for each Notion task before starting work
- Branch naming: `feature/task-name` or `fix/task-name`
- Keep main clean, commit to feature branches
- Create PR when task is complete

## Notion Integration
- Connected to Thuy's Notion workspace via MCP
- Check Notion taskboard (🚀 Tasks) for task details before starting work
- Reference task requirements, checklists, and design images from Notion pages
- Update task status in Notion when work is complete
